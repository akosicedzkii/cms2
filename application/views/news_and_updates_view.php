                    <p>QUEZON CITY, November 27, 2017 - Unioil Petroleum Philippines Inc. (Unioil) has inaugurated today its first Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station located on its newly opened Unioil solar hybrid service station at Congressional Avenue Extension in Quezon City. On display were the state-of- the-art Mitsubishi i- MiEV fully electric vehicle and the Mitsubishi Outlander Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) to the public. Present during the inauguration and ribbon cutting ceremony were Unioil’s Vice President, Noel Soriano, and MMPC’s Vice President for Business Planning and Public Relations Department, Mr. Renato Lampano and other invited guests.<br><br>

                    According to MMPC’s Vice President, Mr. Lampano, &quot;We commend Unioil for its initiative to showcase renewable energy in its first hybrid gasoline station. Like Unioil, Mitsubishi Motors Philippines Corporation is striving to reduce carbon footprint by developing technologies for improving fuel economy and electric-powered systems. The Mitsubishi Electric Vehicle (i-MiEV) and Outlander Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) are the proof of this concept.&quot; Earlier this month, Unioil launched its “Doing Our Part” campaign to encourage everyone to be more conscious about their personal decisions because every small decision has an impact to everyone. Unioil believes that climate change and environmental degradation are real threats to a sustainable future and quality of life. This is why Unioil continues to lead the way in introducing the cleanest range of petroleum products with its introduction of the complete line of Euro5 performance fuels in September 2017, making it the first petroleum company to upgrade to all Euro 5 standard.<br><br>

                    Unioil continues to further strive to reduce the carbon footprint from its own business operations. Unioil has recently started operations of its first “hybrid” service station, which is a station partially powered by solar energy. The latest Unioil station which opened along Congressional Avenue, Quezon City is equipped with the Smartflower TM , the global leader in intelligent solar energy solutions that features an automated sun tracking technology, making it up to 40% more efficient than conventional fixed type solar panels. Each Smartflower TM unit reduces our carbon footprint by 4.7 metric tons annually which is equivalent to planting approximately 5,000 trees per year. According to Unioil’s VP Mr. Noel Soriano, “We are very proud to open to the public our first Unioil Electric Vehicle charging station located in our first Unioil Hybrid Service Station. This will be the first of many Unioil EV charging stations aimed at promoting the use of electric vehicles in the country. We invite everyone to visit our Unioil hybrid station along Congressional Avenue Extension, Quezon City to
                    see and experience the future!”<br><br>


                    The latest effort of Unioil is part of its “Doing Our Part” campaign which encourages Filipinos to make a difference in society through small, everyday actions and responsible decisions they make, including the decision to choose a cleaner fuel.

                    <p>The responsible choice: Unioil cares with its “Doing Our Part” campaign Unioil Petroleum Philippines Inc. launches its ‘Doing Our Part’ campaign to encourage Filipinos to make a difference in society through the small, everyday actions and responsible decisions they make, including the decision to choose a cleaner fuel.<br><br>

                    As pioneers of advanced fuels in the country, Unioil introduces its Euro 5 compliant fuels to give consumers a cleaner and better alternative without the extra cost. Unioil once again becomes the first and only retail petroleum brand to provide the cleanest range of high performance fuels. “People are now becoming conscious about their actions and how it affects society. With our latest campaign, we want to encourage Filipinos to make small yet meaningful decisions that can leave positive and lasting impact to the community,” said Janice Co Roxas-Chua, Chief Financial Officer, Unioil Petroleum Philippines With Unioil’s Euro 5 compliant fuels, motorists can have access to the cleanest range of fuels that have significantly less sulfur content at 10 ppm (parts per million), 5 times cleaner than Euro 4 standard fuels. Based on actual tests conducted by the DENR-EMB, Unioil’s Euro 5 fuels can provide up to 77% less emissions compared to Euro 4 fuels.<br><br>

                    With this, motorists are able to get better engine performance and making a conscious choice to contribute to the environment. Towards a greener Philippines As part of the company’s efforts to reduce the carbon footprint from its own operations, Unioil began its “Hybrid” station program with the installation of Smartflower solar technology in one of its newest retail stations. The Smartflower is equipped with an automated sun tracking technology allowing it to track the sun’s movements across the sky resulting to as much as 40% higher efficiency compared to conventional fixed type solar panels.<br><br>

                    Together with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Unioil has also put up Airvisual nodes in selected locations to help monitor air quality. The petroleum company is also the first to have a commercially-available electric vehicle (EV) charger in one of its retail stations to advocate the use of more EVs for a cleaner environment.<br><br> 

                    The right fuel choice“For the past 50 years, Unioil has always been putting innovative petroleum solutions in the hands of consumers. Today, we continue this by introducing breakthrough ways to harness solar power, promote the use of electric vehicles, and drive with cleaner fuel,” said Kenneth Pundanera, President, Unioil. Unioil’s “Doing Our Part” campaign engages everyone to make meaningful decisions for the community through every day driving with Unioil. With this advocacy, Unioil presents itself as the reliable and cleaner alternative for motorists on their journey towards a healthier society and a greener environment.<br><br>

                    With its programs and Euro 5 performance fuels, Unioil invites motorists, environmental advocates, and families to join its advocacy in making responsible choices for a sustainable and healthier tomorrow.
